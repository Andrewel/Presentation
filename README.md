# Presentation Agile 

(Slide - Brief history)
We start with Historical Background of Agile.Agile approaches is not a new thing as you might expect  they have been around for decades. People used them long before the name Agile was created. Brief History. While colonizing America, settlers travelled to the West, far away from the civilization. They were limited in resources and time, and they had to construct a dwelling before the winter. In the first year they would build small simple houses.It was their MVP. The next year they would build the next part of the house (version 2.0 of their product). Only from 3 year they usually start building an actual solid house. 	Residents of favelas in Brazil have more time, and there’s no winter. But they have limited money and resources. They build their rooms with big bricks, also in an agile fashion. then add windows, lay a roof, and sometimes even paint the walls. When the family grows, they build the next room.	Agile is flexibility out of necessity. It’s being prepared to live in a small house first, meet your team often, work with those who can do several things at once, and add changes as you go.	1)Agile principles are intuitive. When we have limited resources, we become more flexible and go agile. I would add one more point to the Agile Manifesto: “Common sense is more important than anything else, including agile itself.” 		2)If we don’t know whether or not we need the product in the first place, or what the product should look like, we are better off building it in an agile way. Even if we have enough resources. Any experimental project needs an agile approach.	3)If we have resources and know that we do indeed need the product and what it should look like — we should forget about agile and just build it. Otherwise we will pay for two different roofs instead of just one

My name is Andrew Vlasov and today i want to tell you about Agile methodology as simple as possible 
(Slide - Waterfall)
	So, whats wrong with the traditional methodologies?		The main problems that You don’t get to see or test the progress in the software development until the entire product is built.This is especially true when it comes to the traditional waterfall development model.		This model will usually take a lot of time and effort for various developmental procedures, like requirement analysis, design planning, prototype & product development, testing, and final customer acceptance testing.	But the agile development model works on iterations, which allows rapid testing and implementation of results. And , it promotes faster project completion and makes the developmental process highly efficient. (Slide Down)
(Slide - Agile Methodology)
The Agile Methodology
The Agile Methodology is based on iterative and incremental development instead of a linear approach. It does not build an entire system at once, but rather develops incrementally. Less time is invested upfront for documentation and analysis, as clients are constantly seeing and testing the product and providing feedback. The development and feedback process adds accountability and tends to improve client satisfaction by allowing ongoing input.	Agile relies on a very high level of customer involvement throughout every phase of the project. The planning, design, develop, testing, release and feedback are in a constant cycle in a defined period of time. Instead of segmenting projects in stages, agile development tends to address the projects as a whole.	This approach is more flexible. The requirements may change along the way and the team must be able to adapt easily, (the teams are usually smaller). (Slide Down)By using Agile the projects became more successfully as you can see in the statistic below.)(Slide Down)Benefits of following an agile development methodology:
Rapid software development and delivery.
Transparent development process.
Continuous customer/user involvement & feedback.
Reduced software product development timeline.
Easily anticipate and include changes in any developmental stage.Rituals of the Agile.Sprint Planning — Team defines user stories. Main team members involved include scrum master and delivery team..Daily Standups — 15min daily meeting to discuss what they did, what they are doing, and any problems they have..Sprint Review — Team presents what they delivered over a sprint to the product owner.. Retrospectives — Meetings done after sprints to review and revise.
 
(Slide Down)12 principles of agile manifesto.You can visit a link below. 
(Slide Down) Some of principles are Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.Working software over comprehensive documentation.Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.Responding to change over following a plan
(Slide Down)
The best architecter, requirements,and design emerge from self organizing teams

I would add one more point to the Agile Manifesto: “Common sense is more important than anything else, including agile itself.” 	
(Slide - Agile Frameworks)
Types of agile frameworks
(Slide Down)
These are a lot of frameworks for Agile but i want to describe 2 main. Framework sounds techy, it’s really just a way of describing the process and practises that you follow.	The Scrum and Kanban Frameworks are the most preferred ones because they are the most light-weight frameworks that allow the development team to constantly evolve their development process and focus on delivering the product quickly.
(Slide - Scrum Framework)
Scrum is a framework of interactions, operations and roles which are required for flexibility.
This framework allows the developers to deal with complex problems in the development process, while continuing to productively deliver high-quality outcomes. It will always help in easy understanding and functioning of complex product development processes.It follows an incremental product development approach that helps in optimizing the software product and easily accepts changes in the development process.
.The values of Scrum framework- are Commitment to the software product.Openness to accept changes.Courage to try new development processes.Focus on a unified outcome.Respect the outcome of each sprint.Breaks work into chunks called sprints 

(Slide Down)scrum roles
(Slide Down)

Product Owner  -Represents end customer. Defines what is valuable and prioritizes the backlog.	Scrum Team - self-organizing team that includes everyone involved with the design, development, test, and delivery of the finished product. The agile team’s goal is to deliver a quality product that meets the needs of the users.	Scrum Master - facilitates team meetings, removes team impediments, liaises with product owner to ensure the team remains on track.
(Slide - Kanban Frameworks)

2. Kanban Framework
Agile  teams are using Kanban Dashboards in order to track the User Stories and Tasks for each Sprint and for each team member.  Kanban  allows the development team to visualize their entire workflow rather than just viewing the outcome of every process. The development process is generally broken down into multiple problems and is managed using a task board. 
(Slide - Jira Slack Trello Tools)
There are some tools that can help teams with software development.The most popular are Jira,Trello,Slack

(Slide - Conclusion)
Conclusion		Agile is being able to adapt, and being able to put off decisions until you know enough to make them properly.	The highest priority is to satisfy the customer, whether they’re your client, a product owner, your boss, or yourself. Embrace changing requirements, while still getting things done, through early and continuous delivery. This reduces risk, as it prevents delivering the wrong thing, and not realising until you get right to the end!
